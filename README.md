Fortune Cookie App
Made using Java Swing. A portable jar file has been included in the repo which can be downloaded and can be tested. I have used a Fortune Cookie image and a Green background image for a visual treat. I have faced a few issues in making the jar file especially at loading images. After a few tries I have able to create the jar file packed with images and all required files. It's a simple app built using Java Swing.

Features:

1. 50 positive, unique fortunes to keep you motivated
2. Beautiful custom background with a floating button
3. Smooth, rounded UI elements for a modern look

Planning to include more features in Future!
